# Systematic
A mobile app made using RN and Expo. Live in the NOW, NOT tomorrow. Plan your life and follow systems to become consistent.

## Features

### Authentication and data storage
You can login or register with 3 different methods: email + password, gmail or github. All of your task or journal data is stored in a firebase db.

### Timeline
It's an endless scrollable timeline without strict division into days. Instead of procrastinating waiting for a "new day" or a "new week" to start fresh with your new habits, Systematic encourages you to take action *this moment*. If you had a bad day all day long, don't give up and spend the rest of it unproductively because "It's already a bad day" - *what happened before doesn't matter, you are here and now: every second, every moment is a new one*.

You can open a **focus mode** for the active task with a progress bar and timer counting down till the end of the task.

### Journal
Writing your thoughts out daily is essential â€” and Systematic couldn't lack that. The journaling experience is designed to be simple and seamless. But what's most important is the ability to view your past entries for every day, to see how your perception of the world changes and how you develop over time - that's the main focus with this journal.
