# Systematic
A mobile app made using RN and Expo. Live in the NOW, NOT tomorrow. Plan your life and follow systems to become consistent.


## The MVP of the app will consist of 3 main features:

### Timeline
It's an endless scrollable timeline without strict division into days. Instead of procrastinating waiting for a "new day" or a "new week" to start fresh with your new habits, Systematic encourages you to take action *this moment*. If you had a bad day all day long, don't give up and spend the rest of it unproductively because "It's already a bad day" - *what happened before doesn't matter, you are here and now: every second, every moment is a new one*.

When a task begins, the app will enter a **focus mode** with features specific to that task. You can assign them by choosing one of the premade tags or by creating your own and choosing what it should enable. The default focus mode will have a timer counting down till the end of the task and alarm you when the task ends so you can focus on the task itself and not the time - this helps in getting into that renowned *flow state*.

### Journal
Writing your thoughts out daily is essential â€” and Systematic couldn't lack that. The journaling experience is designed to be simple and seamless. But what's most important is the ability to view your past entries for every day, to see how your perception of the world changes and how you develop over time - that's the main focus with this journal.

### Statistics
Being able to see your progress is invaluable. The way it keeps people motivated and consistent is unmatched. Systematic will implement a system where every task you scheduled can be scored with "done", "kinda done" or "not done" so you can assess if the work you take on is doable - it's important not to live in your imagination and be productive *only* there, real progress happens in the real world. You can also see statistics specific to different tasks to keep track of the improvements you make.
